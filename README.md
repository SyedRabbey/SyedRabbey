- 📖 I'm studying Computer Science with a minor in Information Systems Management. 
- 🔭 I’m interested in providing innovative business solutions through programming.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any neat projects that require cloud implementation (AWS/Azure).
- 💬 Outside of coding, I'm into biking, weightlifting, cars, coffee, and a whole lot more! 

I plan to use my Github as a collection of all my projects as well as to advance my coding abilities. I love being able to reflect on my progress in real-time!
